# HappyPlant - UTRA Hacks 2024

### HappyPlant continuously monitors your plant's soil moisture and light exposure levels and uses an AI model to make decisions on whether to water them automatically, or advise you to provide them with better conditions.
## Inspiration
Our inspiration for creating this device lies in the desire to assist individuals who love having house plants but struggle to maintain them due to busy schedules. Our goal is to bridge the gap by combining engineering innovation with a passion for plant care. The cute, intelligent robot we've developed detects when plants need water, ensuring their health even in the busiest households. Real-time monitoring and website updates provide users with a comprehensive view of their plant's well-being, making plant care accessible and stress-free for all plant enthusiasts.
## Scalability
- The HappyPlant framework may be scaled up to industrial-level agricultural setups; increasing crop yield and decreasing waste.
- The framework will allow a given user to add as many plants to their setup as they wish.
